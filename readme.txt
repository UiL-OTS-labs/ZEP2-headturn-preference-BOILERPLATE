Experiment:
        Head-turn Preference Procedure

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to see whether an infant participant 
        can detect a difference between two types of auditory stimuli. The 
        infant sits on the caregiver's lap facing a wall on which a green 
        light, an invisible speaker and a camera is mounted. On each side 
        wall a red light and an invisible speaker are mounted. In this 
        implementation there is a familiarization phase and a test phase. 
        For each trial in the test phase the infant's attention is drawn to 
        one the side lights (blinking). When the infant looks at the blinking 
        light a sequence of sound stimuli starts and a timer runs as long 
        as the infant keeps looking at the blinking light. The trial ends 
        when the infant looks away too long (or when a particular number of 
        stimuli have been presented). In the familiarization phase that 
        precedes the test phase a similar contingency procedure is used but 
        only for the lights; the sound stimuli once started continue until 
        all have been presented. Output test phase: looking time. Output 
        familiarization phase: total looking time.

        In this implementation the front and side lights will be presented
        via three computer monitors. Therefore this implementation requires
        a quad head videocard.
